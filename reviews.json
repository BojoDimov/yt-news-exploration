I didn&#39;t think the first half was too bogged down by expositions. In fact I thought it moved along way too fast and cut out too much thus sacrificing the connection between the viewers and the characters as there was not enough space for the characters to grow and develop and thus really affecting the logic in the main character&#39;s decision. But certain choices by the filmmakers in the first half i felt were good ones as they serve the changes that they made to the movie. The second half however was where everything goes to hell and totally negates every good choices they made in the first half of the movie. Also, for me, a good remake is to add something new or have something new to say that the original missed out or it would be a pointless remake like so many cash grabbing remakes churned out by Hollywood these days. I was hoping for something more because the filmmakers in interviews were saying they delved deeper into the themes in the book in the last half. Sorely disappointed . What they meant by delving deeper was to show the ending that the original movie and the book hinted at (which is more powerful as it was left to the imagination) in all its messy glory. It became a run of the mill horror show. Worst still the supernatural element of the burial ground instead became front and center the main theme of the film when it was supposed to explore the theme of death and its aftermath. Anyone could tell you this is why most Stephen King adaptations ended up failing. When the writers making the adaptation missed the point and made the plot device becomes the plot itself. Also, if anybody who watched the crappy forgettable sequel rushed out by the studio to cash in on the moderate success of the original and starring among others Edward Furlong (shudder!) can see that the filmmakers of this remake was using that as a template for the last half. Improved crap is still crap and it ruined the goodwill of the first half and the whole movie for me as a result.","textOriginal":"I am of the reverse opinion.
