And if it was too expensive, then film in Puerto Rico. We have that legend too!

La Llorona doesn't haunt houses. The fact that the movie happens in a house is stupid by itself. They could've had the family vacationing or camping near a river in the woods, for accuracy's sake. And they should've filmed in a Latin country. And if it was too expensive, then film in Puerto Rico. We have that legend too!
