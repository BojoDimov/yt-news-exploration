  "description": "The main purpose of this project is to develop a scalable architecture for extracting information from YouTube and building some machine learning models over the data. The things I will be extracting are news videos. The concept is as follows:\r 1. Query YouTube API for news channels.\r 2. For every channel, scrape videos information based on some criteria (chronologically, either ascending or descending).\r 3. For every video, scrape commentThreads information (root-level comments).",
